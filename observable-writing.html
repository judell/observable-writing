The journey from apprentice to master craftsman depends on the visibility of all aspects of craft work.

That was the inspiration for a talk I gave at the 2010 Traction User Group meeting, which focused on the theme of <a href="http://blog.jackvinson.com/archives/2010/10/18/observable_work_at_tug2010_owork.html">observable work</a>. In the GitHub era we take for granted that we can craft software in the open, subjecting each iteration to highly granular anaysis and discussion. <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596510046.do">Beautiful Code</a> (2007) invited accomplished programmers to explain their thinking. I can imagine an annotated tour of GitHub repositories as the foundation of a future edition of that book.

I can also imagine crafting prose -- and then explaining the process -- in a similarly open and observable way. The enabling tools don't exist but I'm writing this post in a way that I hope will suggest what they might be. The toolset I envision has two main ingredients: granular versioning and annotation. When I explored <a href="http://fedwiki.org">Federated Wiki</a> last year, I got a glimpse of the sort of versioning that could usefully support analysis of prose craft. The atomic unit of versioning in FedWiki is the paragraph. In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2015/01/12/thoughts-in-motion/">Thoughts in motion</a> I created a plugin that revealed the history of each paragraph in a document. As writers we continually revise our evolving prose. The FedWiki plugin illustrated that process in a compelling way. The sequence of revisions to a paragraph recorded a sequence of decisions. 

<p>
For an expert writer such decisions are often tacit. We apply rules that we've internalized.
