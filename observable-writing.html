The journey from apprentice to master craftsman depends on the visibility of all aspects of craft work.

That was the inspiration for a talk I gave at the 2010 Traction User Group meeting, which focused on the theme of <a href="http://blog.jackvinson.com/archives/2010/10/18/observable_work_at_tug2010_owork.html">observable work</a>. In the GitHub era we take for granted that we can craft software in the open, subjecting each iteration to highly granular anaysis and discussion. <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596510046.do">Beautiful Code</a> (2007) invited accomplished programmers to explain their thinking. I imagine an annotated tour of GitHub repositories as the foundation of a future edition of that book.

I imagine the same kind of approach to crafting prose and then explaining the process.
