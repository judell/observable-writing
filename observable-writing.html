That was the inspiration for a talk I gave at the 2010 Traction User Group meeting which focused on the theme of <a href="http://blog.jackvinson.com/archives/2010/10/18/observable_work_at_tug2010_owork.html">observable work</a>. In the GitHub era we take for granted that we can craft software in the open, subjecting each iteration to highly granular anaysis and discussion. 

In theory we can craft prose in a similarly open way.
